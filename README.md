# Salmon Lake coho salmon NSRAA project
## Introduction

The Northern Southeast Regional Aquaculture Association (NSRAA) has been involved in a multi-year stock assessment of coho salmon (*Oncorhynchus kisutch*) in the Salmon Lake drainage (113-41-10320) near Sitka, Alaska. Information from a past study (Schmidt 1996) described the potential for a declining trend in coho salmon escapement to Salmon Lake due to increased exploitation because of the stock’s proximity to concentrated commercial effort on hatchery stocks, sport fishing effort, and a federal coho salmon subsistence fishery. In response to these concerns, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) operated a weir and conducted mark–recapture escapement estimation experiments at Salmon Lake from 2001 to 2005 (Tydingco et al. 2006, Tydingco et al. 2008). 

In 2007, to fulfill requirements stipulated in the Sawmill Creek Hatchery Basic Management Plan, NSRAA assumed the mark–recapture and weir effort annually (ADF&G 2007). In 2016, NSRAA made a request to ADF&G that adult weir operations may be suspended in place of an increased mark–recapture effort, to allow for escapement estimation at a lower financial cost. This method was approved and implemented during the 2016 fall sampling season (Adams, 2016), modified and implemented again in 2017 (Adams 2017) then further modified and implemented again in 2018 (Adams 2018). The methods used during the 2019 field season was a replica of the same as methods in Adams (2018). The two primary objectives were to estimate escapement and determine the percent of the coho salmon escapement that was of hatchery origin.


## Study Area
Salmon Lake is located 15.2 kilometers southeast of Sitka at the terminus of Silver Bay in eastern Sitka Sound. The lake lies at 17 meters above sea level and is fed primarily by two inlet streams opposite the 1.4-kilometer outlet stream.  The lake is accessible by floatplane, boat, and foot. The U.S. Forest Service maintains a recreational use cabin on the lake and a foot trail that provides access to Salmon Lake from Silver Bay. In addition to coho salmon, Salmon Lake supports populations of sockeye salmon (*O. nerka*), pink salmon (*O. gorbuscha*), chum salmon (*O. keta*), Dolly Varden (*Salvelinus malma*), cutthroat trout (*O. clarki*), steelhead (*O. mykiss*), threespine stickleback (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*), and slimy sculpin (*Cottus cognatus*). Historically (2001–2018), Salmon Lake coho salmon adult mark–recapture escapement estimates have ranged from 708 in 2012 to 3,495 in 2016 (Adams 2018).
